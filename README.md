# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Linus and I am a Computer science engineer that
absolutely loves writing all kinds of cool programs,  
scripts and webapps.

Feel free to browse my profile! I have a couple of fun projects!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
* Contributing to [BetaFlight](https://github.com/betaflight/).
* Freelancing Websites
* Finding new repositories to contribute to...

### âš¡ Fun fact about me  
I made my first program when I was 14.  
( Note to my overly proud younger self, it was an absolutely garbage game )

### ðŸ“« How to reach me

or on Discord Linus#3129
