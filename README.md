# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Linus and I am a Computer Science student  
that absolutely loves writing all kinds of cool programs,  
scripts and webapps. I finish school in June/2023.

Feel free to browse my profile! I have a couple of fun projects!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
* Finishing up School. ( Bachelor in Computer Science, Engineering )
* Contributing to [BetaFlight](https://github.com/betaflight/).
* Finding new repositories to contribute to...

âš¡ Fun fact about me  
I made my first program when I was 13.  
( Note to my overly proud younger self, it was an absolutely garbage game )

ðŸ“« How to reach me  
Best bet is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linus-thorsell/)  
or on Discord Linus#3129
