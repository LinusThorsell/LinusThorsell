# Hey There! 👋👋

My name is Linus and I am an engineer that
absolutely loves writing all kinds of cool programs,  
scripts and webapps. (and sometimes even a robot or two!)

Feel free to browse my profile! I have a couple of fun projects!

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
* Creating [toastyrabbit](https://github.com/LinusThorsell/toastyrabbit)

### ⚡ Fun fact about me  
I made my first program when I was 14.
( Note to my overly proud younger self, it was an absolutely garbage game )

### 📫 How to reach me  
Best bet is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linus-thorsell/)  
or on Discord Linus#3129

### 😿 What now? my readme is over... :(  
Have my Neofetch bunny with some changes as a thanks for reading!
